Meme Generator

Memes have taken the Internet by storm from way back the 1996 dancing baby to the Star Wars meme that seems to be everywhere today. It’s not hard to see why. Jokes are based on shared knowledge, and memes permeate popular conciousness by the shear force of repetition.

Probably the most popular form of meme is an image macro. There is some background image that provides the context with some added text that tells the joke. Sometimes, like the Star Wars meme, there may be multiple lines of text.

While the earliest image macros were probably created using a graphics program, that becomes too tedious for something so formulaic. Wouldn’t it be nice to automate creation of a meme?

**Minimal Requirements**
Create a program that allows you to:

Define a preset list of templates (at least one of which must have multiple text slots) using some file format
Load and view the available meme templates
Select a meme template and populate it with arbitrary text
Save the created meme as a file for retrieval later
Browse all created memes

**Additional Feature Ideas**
How can these memes be shared with a user on another computer or over the internet?
If a user gets bored with the preloaded template, can you give them a way to define their own?
Can users customize the existing templates beyond just changing the text (e.g. fonts / colors / text placement)?
Can you keep track of statistics of which meme templates are the most popular?
