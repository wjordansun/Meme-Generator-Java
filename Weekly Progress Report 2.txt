This week, we have made a lot of progress on our project. Last week we set up the shell of our frontend, but now we have a working backend! Using Spring Boot,
we created a backend that allows us to prove a template name, top text, bottom text, and exported file name. It then generates the template and returns it to the parent folder
of the project. First we tested with postman, but now, in the frontend, we have now created a generate button that sends all of the fields to the backend and generates the meme as provided. What we have to work on now is formatting the fonts to be uniform across image sizes, allowing these memes to be displayed back to the user, and processing user-uploaded memes. There will probably be more that comes along the way, but these items are definitely at the top of the to-do list.
