For the progress made this week, we made our fronted more presentable by giving it a title, along with the creation of another page to display the created memes.
We were able to pull the created images by creating an api call in our next.js + react.js app.
We also started working on the upload function so that the user can upload a meme image of their own to create memes from.
This required us to make another api call and send the image template to the backend for the java code to create the meme.
Because the user is uploading just the image, we also had to have an input for them to select which type of format they wanted,
so that the java code could differentiate between them, and know where to draw the text onto the image using
the graphics2D library.
