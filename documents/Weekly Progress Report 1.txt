Report 1:

This week, we worked on setting up our environment/git repo for the project. We also worked on brainstorming and developing our project plan. 
Currently, we have a React.js/Next.js frontend that contains the bones of our application. At the moment, we only have placeholders for the meme templates that we will
be adding. If the placerholder is clicked, we have a modal that prompts. This modal has a section for "Top Text" and "Bottom Text" that the user will be able to add.
These two text sections will be the text added to the top and bottom of the meme and generate a new image file to be browsed.
